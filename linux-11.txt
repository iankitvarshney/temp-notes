grep command:


grep stands for Global Regular Expression Print.
grep command is used to search for text within files.


cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | wc -l
-> 33

This command prints the number of lines present in that file.


cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep Port
-> Port 22

This command will print every line that contains the word "Port".


For most of the commands in Linux, -v means verbose.
In case of grep command, -v means something else.


cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config | grep -v Port

This command will print every line that did not contain the word "Port".


grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config
-> Port 22

This command will print every line that contains the word "Port".
grep command is able to search within files by itself.


grep Turtle characters.txt

This command will print all lines that contains the word "Turtle".


grep -v Human characters.txt

This command will print all lines that does not contains the word "Turtle".


grep -n Human characters.txt

This command will also print line numbers with each line which contains the word "Human".


grep -c Human characters.txt

This command gives us the count the number of times the given word appears in the file.
But it doesn't show the line themselves.


NOTE:
By default, grep is actually case-sensitive.


grep -i human characters.txt

This command will not care about the case-sensitivity.


grep gedit *

* means it will look through every file.


grep -n gedit *

This command will also show us the line numbers.


grep -r gedit git/personal/ansible/roles/

This command allows us to recursively search through files even through directories to find our match.
In this command, we give the path where we want to start the search from.


grep -ri Error /var/log

This command will also search recursively with case-insensitive.
