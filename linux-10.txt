find command:


find <path> -name <filename>

path represents the path where we want to start our search from.
If we have '.' in place of <path>, it means we want to start our search from the current directory.


find /home/jay -name *.txt

This command will list all the files insides /home/jay ending with .txt
It will also list down the hidden files.


find /home/jay -name *.txt | grep -v .cache

This command will not list the lines of output that will include .cache


find . -name Documents

This command will list all files or folders with the name Documents.


find . -name Documents -type f

This command will list only files with the name Documents.
We can use 'd' for directories.


find . -type f -name Documents -exec rm {} +

This command will delete all files with name Documents inside the current directory.
-exec means we want to execute a command against every item in the result.
The command that we want to execute against every item is rm command.
{}, the curly braces is a placeholder for the actual item itself.
So, everytime the find command finds something, its going to put that something in place of the curly braces.
So, we could almost think of this as a for loop.
Its going to execute this against every item that it finds and a curly braces represent each item that comes up.
'+' at the end is a terminator.
Its the end of the command.
It is basically closing each iteration off.


find . -type f -name Documents -exec rm {} \;

This is another variation where we are using '\;'.
Semicolon is another way to terminate a find command.
When we use semicolon, we have to have a '\' in front of it to escape it out.
This is an issue with the shell.

We can use anything: + or \;
Both of them are used for terminating a find command.


How to change the permissions of every file inside a directory in one shot?


NOTE:
chmod -R 600 Pictures

-R means recursively.
-R is used to apply the changes to everything from that folder where we start this command all the way down to everything underneath it.

This command will also change the permissions for Pictures folder also.


chmod -R u+x Pictures/


find Pictures/ -type f -exec chmod 600 {} +

This command will list all files and then we will execute chmod command on those files.


find Pictures/ -type d -exec chmod 700 {} +

This command will list all folders and then we will execute chmod command on those folders.


sudo find /var/log -type f -name *.log

This command will give us a list of log files inside the given directory.


sudo find /var/log -type f -name *.log -exec truncate -s 0 {} +

This command will list all of the log files inside the given directory.
truncate command is used to truncate a file down to a specific size.
Here, we are truncating log files to size 0.


NOTE:
When we want to do some changes on files/folders using a command, it is very necessary to first see the list of the files on which we are going to execute that command.


find . -name *.mp3


find . -name *.mp3 > results.txt

It will dump the output of find command into results.txt file.
