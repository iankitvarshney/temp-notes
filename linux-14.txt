sort command:
We can sort the data of the file by using the sort command.


sort <filename>

Here, sorting is based on alphabetical order.


For reverse sorting, use the following command.

sort -r <filename>


If the file contains alphanumeric data, then first numbers will be considered and then
alphabet symbols.


If the file contains only numbers, then the sorting is not based on numeric value and it is just based on digits.

$ sort a.txt
11
2
2222222
7
9


If we want to sort based on numeric value then we have to use -n option.
-n means numeric value

$ sort -n a.txt
2
7
9
11
2222222


Bydefault sort command will display duplicate lines. If we want only unique lines then we have to use -u option.
-u meant for unique lines.

$ sort a.txt
1
1
2
2
Bunny
Sunny
Sunny

$ sort -u a.txt
1
2
Bunny
Sunny


Note: We can use -ur and -un options also.


Without using -r option with sort command, sort the content based on reverse of
alphabetical order and store the result inside sorted.txt?

sort a.txt | tac > sorted.txt
sort -r a.txt > sorted.txt

To remove duplicate lines also:

sort -u a.txt | tac > sorted.txt
sort -ru a.txt > sorted.txt


-k means KEYDEF (key definition).
Based on which key (column) we have to sort.


Sort based on File Size in ascending Order:
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 | sort -k 5n

5n means 5th column.


Sort based on Month:
6th column provides total date.
If we want to consider only month then we should use M.
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 |sort -k 6M


Sort based on Number of Links in descending Order:
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 |sort -k 2nr

2nr means 2n for 2nd column and r means reverse.
