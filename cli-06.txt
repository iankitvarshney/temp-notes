Absolute Path:
An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory from the root directory (/) of the file system.
It does not depend on the current working directory.

Relative Path:
A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.
It depends on the context of the current working directory.

Find out what are terminal control codes such as Ctrl + D, Ctrl + C, Ctrl + Z etc and use them

Ctrl + D:

In most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS, pressing Ctrl + D in a terminal is not considered a terminal control code or escape sequence.
Instead, it is a keyboard shortcut that sends an "end-of-file" (EOF) character to the terminal.

Ctrl + C:
Ctrl + C in a terminal sends a "break" signal to the foreground process running in that terminal. 

Ctrl + Z:
Ctrl + Z in a terminal sends a "suspend" signal to the foreground process running in that terminal.


Find out how to use Ctrl + R to reverse search:
Start by pressing Ctrl + R.
Type what you are searching.
press enter to execute the command.
To cancel the reverse search and return to the regular command prompt without executing any command, you can press Ctrl + G.
