awk command:


Its more of a scripting language and its a very useful scripting language that we can use to manipulate text and do all kinds of things.


We can use awk to create filters.
Basically to write scripts to accept data from standard input, change it in some way, and then send that data back out via standard output in this changed form.

In general, standard input is usually in the form of a text file.
And standard output is typically our screen.


cat tmnt.txt

By default, the awk command sees spaces and tabs as delimiters for fields.
So, if awk assumes that each space or tab in between words is the delimiter for a field, 
then what we can glean here is that we have three fields in each of these lines.


awk '{print}' tmnt.txt

This command will print all the content of given file like cat command.
This command will print each field of each line.


awk '{print $1}' tmnt.txt

This command will print the first field of each row.


awk is a scripting language.
{print $2}
This is a script in the brackets.
We can write entire script that will span more than one line.


awk '{print $0}' tmnt.txt

This command will print everything.
Because 0 represents the entire file.


awk '{print $1,$3}' tmnt.txt

This command will print field1 and field3.


We don't have to use awk with a file only.
We can also chain things into awk as well


ls -l | awk '{print $1}'

This command will print the first column of ls -l output.


echo "Hello from LearnLinux.tv" | awk '{print $1}'
-> Hello


echo "Hello from LearnLinux.tv" | awk '{print $1,$3}'
-> Hello LearnLinux.tv


awk '{print $NF}' tmnt.txt

NF stands for Number of fields.
This command will print the last field of each line.


If the fields are not separated by spaces.


awk '{print $2}' /etc/passwd

It will not give us correct output.


-F option:
This option allows us to set a different delimeter or field separator for awk to use to differentiate one field from another.


awk -F':' '{print $2}' /etc/passwd

This command will give us the correct result.


awk -F':' '{print $1,$7}' /etc/passwd

This command will print field1 and field7 of each line.
